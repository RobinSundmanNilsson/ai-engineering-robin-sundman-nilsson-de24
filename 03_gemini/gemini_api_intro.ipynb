      "**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Core Idea:** Organize code around \"objects\" that combine data (attributes) and actions (methods).\n",
      "*   **Key Principles:**\n",
      "    *   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a class.\n",
      "    *   **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (child/subclasses) based on existing classes (parent/superclasses), inheriting their attributes and methods.\n",
      "    *   **Polymorphism:**  The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way (e.g., a `draw()` method that behaves differently for `Circle` and `Square` objects).\n",
      "    *   **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dunder Methods (Magic Methods):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What they are:** Special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`).\n",
      "*   **Purpose:** Define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.  They enable operator overloading and customization of object behavior.\n",
      "*   **Examples:**\n",
      "    *   `__init__`:  Constructor (called when an object is created).\n",
      "    *   `__str__`:  String representation of an object (used by `str()` and `print()`).\n",
      "    *   `__repr__`:  Unambiguous string representation of an object.\n",
      "    *   `__len__`:  Length of an object (used by `len()`).\n",
      "    *   `__add__`:  Addition operator (`+`).\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, OOP provides a way to structure your code, and dunder methods allow you to customize how your objects interact with Python's built-in features.\n",
